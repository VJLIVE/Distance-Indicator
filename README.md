# Distance-Indicator
This is an IOT Project where I had used Arduino UNO SMD Board, A HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo Motor SG90, Breadboard, 7 LED lights, 7 1K ohm resistors, 16 jumper cables, and a buzzer.
The distance will be shown in three types, Servo motor indicates the distance along with the LEDs, and the buzzer will produce sound when the distance between the sensor and the ultrasonic sensor is less than or equal to 30 cm, adding additional proximity features.
Code for this project, Circuit Diagram and Presentation file is uploaded in this repo.
